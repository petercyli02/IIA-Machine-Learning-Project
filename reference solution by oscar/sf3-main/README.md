# Cambidge Engineering part IIA Project sf3 - Machine Learning

One of my third year projects where we looked into modelling and controlling the [cartpole system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum) using various machine learning techniques. Below is the ultimate result: swingup and control of the system with a coarse 0.2 second temporal resolution and under the effect of process noise. Read my full writeup [here](https://github.com/OscarSaharoy/sf3/blob/main/reports/sf3_final_os408_nocoversheet.pdf).
